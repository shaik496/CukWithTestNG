    // Lambda expressions Functional programing --> N number of benfits to enable functional programming.
    // To enable parallel programing or processing

    // what is functional interface


    /*

    if interface only abstartct methods
     --- which contains one abstart method (SAM)
     --- till hava 1.7 we can store only abstaract method in interface
     --- from 1.8 onwords we create default methods + static methods are also interducing
     --- we can have any number of static method and abstract methods
     --- default funtional interfaces in java
     --- Runnable --> Run()
     --- Callable --> call()
     ---- Comparable --> CompareTp();
     ----ActionListener --> Actionperformed();


***** Lambda exp will be invoked using  functional interfaces

@Functional Interface


        // we can use pre-defined functional interfaces in your code



// 1. Predicate
2. Function
3. Consumer
4. Supplier
// java.util.function packate
